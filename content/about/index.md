## About this Blog

This blog serves as a personal record of what I'm learning, building and thinking about. It's primarily interesting for developers, engineers and builders.

I post about software engineering, AI, system design, cybersecurity... basically whatever I'm interested in/working on at the time of writing.

## About me
