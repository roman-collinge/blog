            <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, when you first heard “Tech Debt” you might have thought someone hadn’t paid for their new PC. That’s not quite the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is tech debt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; “Tech debt is the the build up of potential problems from shortcuts taken in a project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try to put it into perspective with an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re working on a project with a tight deadline to present a Minimum Viable Product. Budgets become limited, but you need to impress stakeholders to secure more funding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>So, what is tech debt?</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> “Tech debt is the the build up of potential problems from shortcuts taken in a project.”</p>
<p>Let’s try to put it into perspective with an example.</p>
<p><strong>Situation:</strong> You&rsquo;re working on a project with a tight deadline to present a Minimum Viable Product. Budgets become limited, but you need to impress stakeholders to secure more funding.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> You cut a few corners. Maybe, you don’t document your code. You skip through testing or get ChatGPT to implement some functionality - without taking the time to understand it.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is tech debt.</p>
<p>People will say there isn’t ever a reason to take on tech debt. These are the same people who think projects always ship on time and stakeholders never change their minds - in other words, out of touch.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s sometimes needed. Plans change. Things take longer than expected. Schedules get tight.</p>
<p>In the situation above, you had little choice but to take shortcuts and accrue tech debt. But congratulations, you got funding and the project lives on. 🥳</p>
<p>BUT if the project just moves on without paying off the debt, without considering the mess left behind, things can go really wrong, really quick.</p>
<p><img src="tech-debt-meme.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>These problems occur when you treat tech debt like a payday loan — rushed, spur of the moment decisions with no real plan to repay. You should instead treat it like a mortgage. Planned, approved, and paid off structurally.</p>
<p>So, what should be the terms of your tech debt mortgage?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan your shortcuts</strong> - Know what you’ll skip and when you’ll fix it. This keeps the debt visible and intentional, not accidental.</li>
<li><strong>Get approval</strong> - Talk to your project manager, agree on a clean-up plan. If it’s part of the project plan, it’s less likely to get buried later.</li>
<li><strong>Make time to repay</strong> - Write docs, add tests, understand the code. Treat it like paying back a loan. Small, regular repayments are better than defaulting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The truth is, modern software moves fast. Deadlines, demos, and limited resources mean you’ll probably take on tech debt at some point, if you haven’t already. Just like buying a house, the majority of people need the loan — but you can be smart about how you manage it.</p>
<p>P.S. If this is happening to you all the time, there’s a good chance it’s not your fault. Especially now that you know how to approach it. It’s quite likely to be an organisational problem; poor planning or budgeting. In such a case, speak to your manager and raise the issue. A non-technical manager, or a manager that’s not super involved in the project, might not realise how much tech debt is being accumulated to meet deadlines.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> Tech debt happens. When it does, take it out knowingly, and pay it off sensibly.</p>
